/*
Typescript is a superset of Javascript.

Typescript is a statically typed language b/c it performs type checking at compile time rather than at run time.

It catches an error in development process. This makes a code stable, maintainable ,reliable and error free.

TYPE CHECKING:-
**************

In Typescript, type checking is performed in two ways:-

1- Strongly Type or Explicitly type checking:-
-----------------------------------------------

Developer can defined a data type explicitly when declaring a variable.

*/ let val1 :string="I am Explicitly defined with data type";

/* 2- Implicit Type or inferred by TypeScript:-
------------------------------------------------

In TypeScript, type is automatically inferred by typesccript compiler when it is not explicitly defined by user , on behalf of its value.

*/ let val2=780;  //value is inferred by ts compiler than type of val2 is a number.
